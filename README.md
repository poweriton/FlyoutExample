Nice little slideout menu with tabs

I developed this for a client and thought as i used lots of community examples that i would also try and give a little back.

The project is an asp mvc core application and should open straight up in your VS2017

Run the project and it should work straight away.

Its based on bootstrap 3, however should work just as well with 4. It features an overlayed menu from the right with a set of custom tabs to control

When a tab is clicked then the system makes a post request to return a partial view

The html is in the layout file and the requests/color/icons are controll view html attributes

If you have any questions then just ask
